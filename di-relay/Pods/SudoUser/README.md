# Sudo User iOS SDK

## Overview
The Sudo Platform makes it seamless for developers to integrate Sudo capabilities into their existing applications with minimal effort. For applications that support Open ID Connect, the User SDK enables applications to map their existing users to a Sudo Platform user without the need for end users to create new accounts.
