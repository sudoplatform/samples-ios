# Sudo Profiles iOS SDK
  
## Overview
In the world of data-brokering, targeted ads, and digital profiling, users can feel abandoned in their digital world. Malicious uses of personal information has created increasing distrust and reduced feelings of cyber safety.

We created Sudo digital identities (Sudos, pronounced su-dohs) to help users protect themselves against the rising wave of privacy scandals and security breaches that are happening every day. Sudo digital identities allow your users interact with other people and services while protecting against the misuse of their personal data and legal identity information.

Please see the [Sudo Platform Developer Docs](https://sudoplatform.com/docs) for an overview of Sudos in the Sudo Platform.
